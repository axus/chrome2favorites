[Building GCC 4.5.0]

The GCC standard C++ library (libstdc++) and the GCC library (libgcc) are
distributed under the LGPL. If these libraries are distributed in shared
library form, such as a DLL, their source code must be made available.

If you are distributing programs built with MinGW, it is a good idea to include
these DLLs and distribute their source. Otherwise, you must statically link
them with --static-libgcc and --static-libstdc++.

The source package prepared by MinGW has a build script to make the process
easier.  It runs the initial configuration with the correct options.  You can
edit pkgbuild.ini to change them.

The GCC build process goes through 3 stages:
*Stage 1: Build a GCC compiler and libraries with whatever your current compiler is.

*Stage 2: Build GCC and libraries using your configuration options, with the
        stage 1 compiler.

*Stage 3: Build GCC using stage 2 compiler, compare itself to the stage 2 compiler,
        and build libraries.

See the official GCC Build page for more information about the build process.

[Prerequisites]

Install MSYS with MSYS developer package selected.
Install 7zip.
Install required libraries:
  mingw-get install msys-dvlpr
  mingw-get install gmp mpc mpfr pthreads
Copy the "startup file" objects to where GCC looks for them:
  cp /mingw/lib/dllcrt2.o /mingw/mingw32/lib/
  cp /mingw/lib/crt*.o /mingw/mingw32/lib/

[Download gcc source]

Download MinGW's GCC source package from SourceForge: Version 4.5.0-1
Open the the .lzma file with 7zip, and double-click the .tar file inside 7zip.
Extract to $HOME/gccbuild/

[Optimizing Windows]

A GCC compile heavily uses the CPU and disk.
Some of these steps might let you compile faster:
  Turn off special effects in "Control Panel" > "System" > "Advanced" > "Perfomance Settings".
  Close all unnecessary programs.
  For each hard drive properties, uncheck "Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed".
    Windows XP: Run services.msc, stop "Indexing Service", and disable it.
    Windows Vista/7: Run services.msc, stop "Windows Search", and disable it.
  Configure your Windows antivirus software to ignore $HOME/gccbuild .

[Run build script]

The build script takes a long time to run. Plan to do something else while GCC is compiling.  Check it after 30-60 minutes for any errors.  Estimated build time is two to five hours.
  Edit pkgbuild.ini
  Change the --enable-languages option to just C and C++
    "--enable-languages=c,c++ \"
  Start the MinGW Shell
  cd gccbuild
  pkgbuild
    Source extraction speed depends on your hard drive speed.  5 minutes to 1 hour.
    Initial "configure" step took about 5 minutes.
    "configure" and "make" is run for each subfolder, in 3 stages.
    If you made a mistake setting up, errors can occur anytime in the first stage.

[Fixing errors]

I had errors because I was missing prerequisites, and didn't copy the *crt*.o
files to /mingw/mingw32/lib/.

If you have errors, look for the last "config.log" created in the build tree.  Then:
  Fix the error
  cd $HOME/gccbuild/build
  make
    
Error: "cannot find dllcrt2.o: No such file or directory"
Solution:  Copy the missing startup files objects to /mingw/mingw32/lib/

Error: "../../gcc-4.5.0/gcc/ada/gcc-interface/Make-lang.in:606: *** multiple target patterns.  Stop."
Solution:  mingw-get install gcc-ada, remove ada from pkgbuild.ini

Error: "configure: error: in `/c/dev/axus/gccbuild/build/mingw32/libgomp':
        configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
Solution:  cp /mingw/lib/crt2.o /mingw/mingw32/lib/

Error: "mv: cannot move `mingw32' to `stage1-mingw32': Permission denied"
Solution:  Close files and directories you've opened from the "build" folder tree.

Error: "configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 2.3.1+ and MPC 0.8.0+"
Solution:  
    rm -rf build
    mingw-get install gmp mpfr mpc
    pkgbuild    #Yes, it has to extract all over again!                    

[After the build completes]

The final output from the build should be:
  "make[1]: Leaving directory `/d/dev/gcc/build'"

Undo any Windows optimizations that you did against your better judgement.

The libgcc DLL was created here:
$HOME/gccbuild/build/mingw32/libgcc/shlib/libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

The libstdc++ DLL was created here:
$HOME/gccbuild/build/mingw32/libstdc++-v3/.libs/libstdc++-6.dll

[Install]

If you want to install your new GCC, run "make install".  You may distribute
anything created under "gccbuild" if you can provide source and build
instructions.  This will overwrite installed MinGW files with your own compiled
versions.

To revert back to the original DLL versions, run "mingw-get install libgcc libstdc++"

My compiled libstdc++-6.dll was over 6MB.  The version included with MinGW is
only 860KB.  However, my libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll and the MinGW version were both
108032 bytes.  They were not identical.

[Build times]

Windows XP laptop (Core 2 Duo): About 5 hours
Windows Vista laptop (Core 2 Duo): 2.5 hours
Windows 7 desktop (i5-750, SSD): 2.5 hours, including fixing and rerunning "make"!
