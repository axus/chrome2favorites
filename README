chrome2favorites: Convert Chrome bookmarks file to IE Favorites.

BUILDING:
    Requires MinGW + MSYS
    Build libjsoncpp, install to /usr/local
    Run "make"
    

This project is derived from the original 
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/export_chrome_bookmarks.aspx
By: Alan_Zhang and 365days.enjoy


I changed it to build in MSYS/MinGW, removed a couple crashes, and got rid of
some unnecessary directory structure.

chrome2favorites depends on jsoncpp, which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp/

Chrome2Favorites.exe also depends on MinGW/GCC shared libraries. See 
build_gcc.txt.
