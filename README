chrome2favorites: Convert Chrome bookmarks file to IE Favorites.

This project is derived from the original

By: Alan_Zhang and 365days.enjoy

I changed it to build in MSYS/MinGW, and removed a couple crashes.
I removed the original Visual Studio project file, since I don't use MSVC.
You could obtain it from the original project.

It depends on jsoncpp, which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp/
