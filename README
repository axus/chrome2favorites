chrome2favorites: Convert Chrome bookmarks file to IE Favorites.

This project is derived from the original

I changed it to build in MSYS/MinGW, removed a couple crashes, and got rid of
some unnecessary directory structure.

Scripts for building the project:
build-msys.sh = Windows with MinGW + MSYS

chrome2favorites depends on jsoncpp, which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp/

Chrome2Favorites.exe also depends on MinGW/GCC shared libraries. See 
build_gcc.txt.
